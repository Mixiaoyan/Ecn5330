We will be using the Git version control system in this course. I will use Git to disseminate course materials, and students will use Git for submission of homework assignments and final projects.

All students should apply for a [free educational account at GitHub](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). This will allow you to create private repositories on GitHub, where you will push your assignments and final projects.

I will present a basic tutorial on using Git. The following are also helpful resources:

# Version Control with Git

* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)
* [Try Git](http://try.github.io//levels/1/challenges/1)
* [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
* [Git Reference](http://gitref.org)
* [Official Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs)

Here is a great introductory video by Scott Chacon of GitHub.
