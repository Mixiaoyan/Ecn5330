# Version Control with Git

Knowledge of the Git version control system is a prerequisite for Bios 8366. We will be using Git for submission of homework assignments and your final projects, as well as for obtaining course materials.

All students should apply for a [free educational account at GitHub](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). This will allow you to create private repositories on GitHub, where you will push your assignments and final projects. Those who signed up for accounts in Bios6301 may need to request a renewal of their student account.

For those enrolled that have not taken Bios 6301, here are several resources to get you familiar with Git:

* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)
* [Try Git](http://try.github.io//levels/1/challenges/1)
* [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)
* [Git Reference](http://gitref.org)
* [Official Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs)

Here is a great introductory video by Scott Chacon of GitHub.
