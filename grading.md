# Grading and Assignments

Students will be assesed according to the following:

- Participation and professionalism (30%)
	+ It is essential that you actively participate in class discussions and demonstrate professional behavior. No
	  student can earn an A grade without this!
	+ Weekly programming, writing, and reading assignments.
	+ Assignments must be submitted as Jupyter notebooks and PDF files created by the `nbconvert` tool. 
- A final econometric project (40%)
	+ You may work in groups of two. I will allow one group of three if there is an odd number of students (but I must
	  approve the group!). 
- Two final essays (30%)
	+ Topic 1: *What should financial econometricians do?*
	+ Topic 2: *Manipulation on trial*

The final project and essays will be submitted in multiple stages:

- Proposal & outline
- Rough draft
- Final submission 

Dates for each of these stages will be discussed in class and updated on the Google Sheet schedule. 

**Special Grading Policy:**

I will allow students to hand in work muliple times until a student receives 100% credit for each assignment. I will
also keep track of the number of times work is submitted. This will enter the student's final grade under participation
and professionalism. It is important to me that you actually acquire the skills and gain the knowledge outlined in the
intended course outcomes!
